# Pacx
A simple pacman wrapper inspired from `powerpill` and `nala`.

# Building
To compile the project form source, clone the repo and run make. The binary will be inside the *bin* directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/abdurehmanimran/pacx.git
cd pacx
make
```
or
```
make build-release
```

# Why C?
Just so that I could learn and practice C.

# Credit
- `aria2c` for enabling ultra-fast downloads of packages.
- `pacman`
- `powerpill` and `nala` for the idea.
